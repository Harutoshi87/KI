Silla was a kingdom of Gode in the southeastern part of the Korean Peninsula that was founded by King Park Hyuk-geose in 57 B.C. Initially, it was a small tribal nation centered on the Gyeongju area, but gradually expanded its power and grew into a powerful nation on the Korean Peninsula by presiding over the Han River glaze during King Jinheung's reign in the 6th century. In the 7th century, Baekje and Goguryeo were destroyed one after another thanks to the activities of Kim Chun-chu (King Taejong Muyeol) and Kim Yu-shin, reunifying the three countries in 676. This is called Unified Silla, and for the next 200 years, most of the Korean Peninsula was annexed.Buddhist culture flourished during the Unified Silla Period, and world-class cultural heritages such as Bulguksa Temple and Seokguram Grotto were created during this period. Also, after reunification, a centralized bureaucracy and a social status system were expanded. However, from the late ninth century, it gradually declined due to aristocratic power struggles, peasant uprisings, and the growth of local families, and eventually collapsed when the last king, Gyeongsun, surrendered to King Taejo of the Goryeo Dynasty in 935.실러 와즈 어 킹덤 어브 고우드 인 더 사우씨스턴 파아트 어브 더 코어리언 퍼닌설러 댓 와즈 파운디드 바이 킹 파아크 혁 지오우스 인 피프티 세번 비시 이니셜리, 잇 와즈 어 스몰 트라이벌 네이션 센터드 안 더 곙주 에어리어. ...더보기
